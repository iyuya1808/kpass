# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KPASS is a Flutter-based mobile application designed for iOS and Android that serves as a client for Keio University's K-LMS (Canvas-based learning management system). The app enables students to access course information, synchronize assignment deadlines with their local device calendar, and receive reminder notifications. The application prioritizes security by storing authentication tokens locally using encrypted storage and does not rely on external databases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication and Token Management

**User Story:** As a Keio University student, I want to securely log into K-LMS through the app so that I can access my course information without repeatedly entering credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a WebView with the K-LMS login page (https://lms.keio.jp)
2. WHEN the user completes Shibboleth authentication in the WebView THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and extract the Canvas access token
3. IF automatic token extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback UI for manual token input
4. WHEN a valid token is obtained THEN the system SHALL store it securely using flutter_secure_storage
5. WHEN the user logs out THEN the system SHALL delete the stored token and clear all cached data
6. WHEN the app starts with an existing token THEN the system SHALL validate the token by calling /api/v1/users/self
7. IF the stored token is invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 2: Canvas API Integration

**User Story:** As a student, I want the app to retrieve my course and assignment information from K-LMS so that I can view my academic schedule and deadlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL fetch course list using /api/v1/courses endpoint
2. WHEN displaying course details THEN the system SHALL fetch assignments using /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/assignments endpoint
3. WHEN retrieving calendar events THEN the system SHALL use /api/v1/users/self/calendar_events or /api/v1/calendar_events endpoint
4. WHEN API responses are paginated THEN the system SHALL handle pagination automatically
5. WHEN API calls fail with 401 status THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
6. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
7. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL cache data locally for offline viewing

### Requirement 3: Local Calendar Synchronization

**User Story:** As a student, I want assignment deadlines to be automatically added to my device's calendar so that I can see them alongside my other appointments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assignments with deadlines are retrieved THEN the system SHALL create calendar events in the device's native calendar
2. WHEN creating calendar events THEN the system SHALL include the Canvas assignment ID to prevent duplicates
3. WHEN assignment details are updated THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event
4. WHEN assignments are deleted or completed THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding calendar event
5. WHEN the app requests calendar access THEN the system SHALL explain the purpose and request appropriate permissions
6. IF calendar permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL continue to function without calendar sync and inform the user
7. WHEN calendar sync is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide settings to control sync scope and frequency

### Requirement 4: Push Notifications and Local Reminders

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive timely reminders about upcoming assignment deadlines so that I don't miss important submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an assignment deadline is detected THEN the system SHALL schedule a local notification 24 hours before the deadline by default
2. WHEN the user opens notification settings THEN the system SHALL allow customization of reminder timing (1h/6h/24h options)
3. WHEN notifications are scheduled THEN the system SHALL use flutter_local_notifications for cross-platform compatibility
4. WHEN FCM is configured THEN the system SHALL register for push notifications using firebase_messaging
5. IF push notifications are unavailable THEN the system SHALL rely entirely on local notifications
6. WHEN the user disables notifications THEN the system SHALL cancel all scheduled notifications
7. WHEN new assignments are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically schedule appropriate reminders

### Requirement 5: Background Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a student, I want the app to automatically check for new assignments and updates even when I'm not actively using it so that I stay informed about changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL use workmanager (Android) or background_fetch (iOS) for periodic updates
2. WHEN background sync runs THEN the system SHALL poll Canvas API for new assignments and changes
3. WHEN new assignments are detected in background THEN the system SHALL update local notifications and calendar events
4. WHEN background sync frequency is configured THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for battery optimization
5. IF background sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
6. WHEN the device is low on battery THEN the system SHALL reduce sync frequency automatically
7. WHEN the user configures sync settings THEN the system SHALL allow selection of sync intervals (15min/1h/6h/daily)

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a student, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface that reflects Keio University's branding so that the app feels familiar and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface using Keio colors (red accent, white/black base)
2. WHEN displaying the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show course cards with assignment counts and recent activity
3. WHEN viewing course details THEN the system SHALL display assignments, modules, and resources in an organized layout
4. WHEN viewing assignment details THEN the system SHALL show deadline, submission status, and calendar sync options
5. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide sections for calendar sync, notifications, and account management
6. WHEN the user has accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL support font size adjustment and high contrast modes
7. WHEN displaying loading states THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and progress indicators

### Requirement 7: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a student, I want my authentication credentials and personal data to be securely stored and never transmitted to unauthorized servers so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use flutter_secure_storage with encryption
2. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL ensure all stored credentials are removed
3. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL only communicate with official K-LMS endpoints
4. WHEN caching data locally THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
5. IF the device is compromised THEN the system SHALL minimize exposure through secure storage practices
6. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL comply with applicable privacy regulations
7. WHEN the user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all locally stored information

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Compatibility

3. WHEN using platform-specific features THEN the system SHALL handle differences gracefully
4. WHEN requesting permissions THEN the system SHALL use appropriate platform-specific permission flows
5. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL follow platform-specific notification guidelines
6. WHEN handling background tasks THEN the system SHALL respect platform-specific limitations
7. WHEN building for release THEN the system SHALL meet both App Store and Google Play requirements

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Offline Support

2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL guide the user through re-authentication process
